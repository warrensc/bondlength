# bondlength

These scripts are to be run in order from 1 to 4.

Script 1 reads .cif files from the Materials Project and writes them into a more readable format for subsequent processing.
Script 2 reads the output from script 1 and calculates nearest neighbor bond distances.
Script 3 collects the output from script 2 and builds a histogram.
Script 4 edits the histogram to write it as a .csv file.

Upon download, each script will need to be modified to correctly set the input and output directories.
